            <h1 id='DeepSeek - Advanced Buddhist Practice Inquiry'>DeepSeek - Advanced Buddhist Practice Inquiry</h1><br>
<p><mark class="highlighted">I've been reading and practicing buddhism for a while. I've read some books from Chogyan Trungpa and Thich Nhat Han that were foundational for my practice. One of the things that is happening now is that I am starting to come into close contact with the basic dispair constantly. I can notice myself trying to pull or push situations in and out, running from pain, seeking pleasure, feeling sad, even meditating to escape, to create a situation different than the one that is. It seems like masters like trungpa have reached a state of being where they feel all this, but they are calm, composed, not running. How can I practice being in this state? For instance, right now, I am here, writting this as a form to escape the fact that I have to deal with a task at work. I know that the level of practice I am in now requires me to stop running, surrendering and working with the situation. But I can't go beyond dispair, when I try to, I end up creating strategies like "If I take a cold shower, I'll have created conditions for focusing" and so on. But nothing works. Practically speaking, where can I find, sense, invite to be, this surrender to the situation right now?</mark></p><br>
<p>Your reflections show a deep awareness of your mind and its patterns, which is a significant step in your practice. What you're experiencing—coming face-to-face with basic despair, the urge to escape, and the struggle to surrender—is a natural part of the path. Even the masters you admire, like Chögyam Trungpa and Thich Nhat Hanh, likely encountered similar challenges in their journeys. The difference is not that they no longer feel these things, but that they have learned to relate to them with openness, compassion, and non-resistance.</p><br>
<p>Here are some practical steps to help you work with this sense of despair and the urge to escape:</p><br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='1. **Acknowledge and Be Present with What Is**'>1. <b>Acknowledge and Be Present with What Is</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Instead of trying to push away the despair or the discomfort of your work task, simply acknowledge it. Say to yourself, "This is what is happening right now." Notice the physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts without judgment. This is the essence of mindfulness.<br></li>
<li>For example, when you feel the urge to escape, pause and ask, "What is here right now?" Feel the tension, the resistance, or the fear. Let it be there without trying to fix it.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='2. **Practice "Being With" Rather Than "Doing About"**'>2. <b>Practice "Being With" Rather Than "Doing About"</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Often, we try to solve or escape discomfort by <i>doing</i> something—like taking a cold shower or meditating to "fix" our state. Instead, try <i>being with</i> the discomfort. This is the practice of surrender.<br></li>
<li>When you notice yourself strategizing or running, gently bring your attention back to the present moment. Feel your breath, your body, and the raw experience of what is happening. This is where surrender begins—not in changing the situation, but in changing your relationship to it.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='3. **Use the Discomfort as Your Teacher**'>3. <b>Use the Discomfort as Your Teacher</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Despair, resistance, and the urge to escape are not obstacles to your practice—they <i>are</i> your practice. They show you where you are clinging, where you are resisting, and where you have the opportunity to let go.<br></li>
<li>Ask yourself: "What is this discomfort trying to show me? What am I afraid of? What am I holding onto?" These questions can help you uncover deeper layers of your mind and heart.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='4. **Ground Yourself in the Body**'>4. <b>Ground Yourself in the Body</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>When the mind is caught in despair or resistance, the body can be a powerful anchor. Bring your attention to the sensations in your body—the feeling of your feet on the ground, the weight of your body on the chair, or the movement of your breath.<br></li>
<li>If you feel overwhelmed, try a simple practice like "STOP":<br>
<ul>
<li><b>S</b>top what you're doing.<br></li>
<li><b>T</b>ake a breath.<br></li>
<li><b>O</b>bserve your body, mind, and emotions.<br></li>
<li><b>P</b>roceed with awareness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='5. **Cultivate Compassion for Yourself**'>5. <b>Cultivate Compassion for Yourself</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>It's easy to be hard on yourself when you feel stuck or unable to surrender. Instead, offer yourself the same kindness you would offer a friend in distress. Recognize that this is part of the human experience and that you are not alone in feeling this way.<br></li>
<li>You might silently say to yourself, "It's okay to feel this. May I be kind to myself in this moment."</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='6. **Work with the Task at Hand**'>6. <b>Work with the Task at Hand</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>If you're avoiding a work task, try breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps. Instead of focusing on the entire task, just take the first small step. Often, the resistance is worse than the task itself.<br></li>
<li>As you work, bring mindfulness to the process. Notice the sensations of typing, the sounds around you, or the movement of your hands. This can help you stay grounded in the present moment.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='7. **Reflect on Impermanence**'>7. <b>Reflect on Impermanence</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Remind yourself that this moment, this feeling, and this situation are not permanent. Despair, resistance, and even joy are all fleeting. By recognizing the impermanent nature of your experience, you can loosen your grip on it and find a sense of spaciousness.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='8. **Connect with Your Intention**'>8. <b>Connect with Your Intention</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Why do you practice? What is your deeper intention in life? Connecting with your intention can help you find the courage to stay present, even when it's difficult. Whether it's to cultivate peace, wisdom, or compassion for yourself and others, let your intention guide you.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='9. **Seek Support**'>9. <b>Seek Support</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>If you feel stuck, consider reaching out to a teacher, a meditation group, or a community of practitioners. Sometimes, sharing your experience with others can provide new insights and remind you that you're not alone on this path.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='A Simple Practice for Right Now:'>A Simple Practice for Right Now:</h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Pause for a moment. Feel your breath. Notice the sensations in your body. Acknowledge whatever is present—despair, resistance, or the urge to escape. Let it be there without trying to change it. Then, gently return your attention to the task at hand, bringing mindfulness to each small action.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<p>Remember, the goal is not to eliminate despair or discomfort, but to relate to it with openness and curiosity. Over time, this practice of surrender and presence will become more natural, and you'll find a deeper sense of calm and composure, even in the midst of life's challenges. Trust the process, and be patient with yourself.</p><br>
<p><mark class="highlighted">Yes, it is clear to me that the goal is not to eliminate. I understand the exercises, but I still lack the intuitive notion and thus understanding of how to be with the problems. I need something deeper, or, I don't know what I need, but I feel like I am closing to grasping this intuitive way of "positioning" my mind to make situations workable</mark></p><br>
<p>What you’re describing—the search for an intuitive, deeper understanding of how to "be with" problems—is a profound and natural part of the path. It’s not just about knowing the exercises or techniques intellectually; it’s about <i>embodying</i> a shift in how you relate to your experience. This shift is subtle, but it can be cultivated through practice and insight. Let’s explore how you might move closer to this intuitive understanding.</p><br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='1. **Recognize the Gap Between Knowing and Embodying**'>1. <b>Recognize the Gap Between Knowing and Embodying</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>You already understand the teachings intellectually, but there’s a gap between this understanding and the lived, embodied experience of "being with" your problems. This gap is not a failure—it’s where the practice happens. It’s where you learn to <i>trust</i> the process of letting go and opening to what is.<br></li>
<li>The intuitive understanding you’re seeking is not something you can force or grasp. It arises naturally as you continue to practice and deepen your relationship with your mind and heart.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='2. **Shift from "Doing" to "Being"**'>2. <b>Shift from "Doing" to "Being"</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Much of our struggle comes from trying to <i>do</i> something about our experience—fix it, change it, or escape it. The intuitive shift you’re looking for involves moving from "doing" to "being." This means resting in awareness itself, rather than trying to manipulate your experience.<br></li>
<li>Try this: Instead of asking, "How can I fix this?" or "How can I be with this?" simply pause and ask, "What is already here?" Notice the awareness that is present, the space in which everything is happening. This awareness is always here, even in the midst of despair or resistance. Rest in it.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='3. **Cultivate Trust in the Present Moment**'>3. <b>Cultivate Trust in the Present Moment</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>The intuitive understanding you’re seeking comes from trusting the present moment, exactly as it is. This doesn’t mean you have to like it or approve of it—it simply means acknowledging that this is what is happening right now.<br></li>
<li>Practice saying to yourself, "This is it. This is what’s here." Feel the raw reality of the moment, without trying to change it. Over time, this practice can help you develop a deeper trust in the unfolding of life.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='4. **Explore the Nature of the "I"**'>4. <b>Explore the Nature of the "I"</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Often, the sense of struggle comes from identifying with the "I" that feels despair, resistance, or confusion. But who is this "I"? Is it solid and unchanging, or is it a collection of thoughts, feelings, and sensations that arise and pass away?<br></li>
<li>Investigate this "I" through inquiry. Ask yourself, "Who is the one who is struggling? Who is the one who wants to understand?" Look deeply into the nature of the self. This inquiry can help you loosen your identification with the mind’s stories and open to a more intuitive way of being.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='5. **Practice Open Awareness**'>5. <b>Practice Open Awareness</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Instead of focusing on a specific object (like the breath or a mantra), try practicing open awareness. Sit quietly and allow everything to be as it is—thoughts, emotions, sensations, sounds. Don’t try to control or direct your attention. Simply rest in the open space of awareness.<br></li>
<li>This practice can help you develop a more intuitive sense of "being with" whatever arises, without needing to position your mind in any particular way.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='6. **Use the Body as a Gateway**'>6. <b>Use the Body as a Gateway</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>The body can be a powerful gateway to the intuitive understanding you’re seeking. When you feel stuck or overwhelmed, bring your attention to the physical sensations in your body. Feel the aliveness, the energy, and the presence that is always here.<br></li>
<li>Notice how the body responds to thoughts and emotions. For example, when you feel despair, where do you feel it in your body? What does it feel like? By tuning into the body, you can bypass the mind’s stories and connect with a deeper, more intuitive way of being.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='7. **Let Go of the Need to Understand**'>7. <b>Let Go of the Need to Understand</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Paradoxically, the intuitive understanding you’re seeking may come when you stop trying to understand. The mind loves to analyze, figure things out, and find solutions, but the deeper wisdom you’re looking for is beyond the mind’s reach.<br></li>
<li>Practice letting go of the need to know or understand. Instead, simply be present with what is. Trust that the intuitive understanding will arise on its own, in its own time.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='8. **Reflect on the Teachings of Non-Duality**'>8. <b>Reflect on the Teachings of Non-Duality</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>The intuitive shift you’re seeking is often described in non-dual teachings as a recognition that there is no separation between you and your experience. The despair, the resistance, the confusion—they are not separate from you. They are expressions of your own mind.<br></li>
<li>Reflect on this: There is no "you" who needs to "be with" the problems. There is only the unfolding of experience, moment by moment. When you see this clearly, the struggle naturally falls away.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='9. **Be Patient and Gentle with Yourself**'>9. <b>Be Patient and Gentle with Yourself</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>This intuitive understanding is not something you can rush or force. It arises naturally, through consistent practice and a willingness to be present with whatever arises. Be patient with yourself, and trust that you are exactly where you need to be.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='A Simple Practice for Intuitive Understanding:'>A Simple Practice for Intuitive Understanding:</h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Sit quietly and bring your attention to the present moment. Notice whatever is arising—thoughts, emotions, sensations. Instead of trying to change or understand anything, simply rest in the awareness that is already here.<br></li>
<li>Ask yourself, "What is aware of this experience?" Feel into the space of awareness itself. This is where the intuitive understanding you’re seeking begins to unfold.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<p>The intuitive way of "positioning" your mind is not about positioning at all—it’s about letting go of the need to position anything. It’s about resting in the natural awareness that is always here, always open, and always free. Trust that as you continue to practice, this understanding will deepen and become more accessible. You are already closer than you think.</p><br>
<p><mark class="highlighted">So, what I'm trying to get at, is at the root of the situation and my relationship with it. You see, when you suggest what to reflect, what to ask myself, what to notice, there is a root, core action that is taken to open. There needs to be at least the action of opening up. I am not looking for pausing to open up, but open up anytime, in the happening</mark></p><br>
<p>Ah, I see now—you’re pointing to the <i>root action</i>, the fundamental shift that allows you to "open up" in the midst of life, without needing to pause, reflect, or apply a technique. You’re asking how to embody this openness <i>as it’s happening</i>, in the flow of experience, without stepping back or creating distance. This is a profound inquiry, and it touches on the very essence of practice.</p><br>
<p>What you’re describing is the ability to <i>be openness itself</i>, rather than someone who <i>does openness</i>. It’s about living from a place of natural, spontaneous presence, where the boundary between "you" and "the situation" dissolves. Let’s explore this.</p><br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='1. **The Root Action Is Already Happening**'>1. <b>The Root Action Is Already Happening</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>The openness you’re seeking is not something you need to create or activate—it’s already here. It’s the space in which all experience arises. The problem is that we often overlook it because we’re so identified with the content of our experience (thoughts, emotions, sensations) rather than the awareness that holds it.<br></li>
<li>To recognize this openness, you don’t need to <i>do</i> anything. You simply need to <i>notice</i> what’s already here. The moment you notice, you’re already open. This noticing is the root action.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='2. **Dissolve the Separation Between "You" and "The Situation"**'>2. <b>Dissolve the Separation Between "You" and "The Situation"</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>The sense of separation—between "you" and "the situation," or "you" and "the problem"—is what creates the need to "open up." But in reality, there is no separation. The situation is not happening <i>to you</i>; it’s happening <i>as you</i>. It’s all one seamless flow of experience.<br></li>
<li>To embody this, try this inquiry: When you feel resistance or struggle, ask yourself, "Where is the boundary between me and this experience?" Look closely. Is there really a solid line, or is it just a thought, a story created by the mind?</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='3. **Let Go of the "Doer"**'>3. <b>Let Go of the "Doer"</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>The idea that you need to "open up" implies that there’s a "you" who needs to do something. But what if there’s no "doer"? What if openness is the natural state, and the only thing obscuring it is the belief that you need to <i>make</i> it happen?<br></li>
<li>Practice letting go of the sense of being the "doer." Instead of trying to open up, simply rest as awareness itself. Notice that awareness is already open, already spacious, already free.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='4. **Embody the "Being Mode"**'>4. <b>Embody the "Being Mode"</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Most of us live in the "doing mode," where we’re constantly trying to achieve, fix, or change something. The "being mode" is different—it’s a way of living where you allow life to unfold without interference.<br></li>
<li>To shift into the being mode, try this: Throughout your day, pause for a moment and ask, "What is happening right now?" Then, instead of trying to change anything, simply let it be. Feel the aliveness of the moment, the raw presence of experience. This is openness in action.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='5. **Trust the Intelligence of Life**'>5. <b>Trust the Intelligence of Life</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>The situations you encounter—whether at work, in relationships, or in your practice—are not random. They are expressions of life’s intelligence, opportunities for you to wake up to the truth of who you are. Trust that life is unfolding exactly as it needs to, and that you don’t need to control or manipulate it.<br></li>
<li>When you trust life in this way, openness becomes your natural response. You don’t need to "open up" because you’re already open.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='6. **Practice Non-Resistance**'>6. <b>Practice Non-Resistance</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Resistance is what closes you off. It’s the mental and emotional tightening that happens when you don’t want something to be as it is. Non-resistance, on the other hand, is openness in action.<br></li>
<li>When you notice resistance, don’t try to get rid of it. Instead, feel it fully. Notice where it shows up in your body, your emotions, your thoughts. By feeling it completely, you allow it to dissolve on its own, and openness naturally arises.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='7. **Live as Awareness Itself**'>7. <b>Live as Awareness Itself</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>The deepest level of openness is to live as awareness itself. This means recognizing that you are not the thoughts, emotions, or sensations that arise—you are the awareness in which they appear.<br></li>
<li>To practice this, try this simple inquiry: "Who is aware of this experience?" Look for the "I" that is aware. What do you find? Is there a solid "I," or is there just awareness, open and free?</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='8. **Let Life Live You**'>8. <b>Let Life Live You</b></h3><br>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, openness is not something you do—it’s something you allow. It’s the recognition that life is living you, moment by moment. There’s no separate "you" who needs to open up; there’s just life, unfolding in its infinite intelligence.<br></li>
<li>To embody this, try this practice: Throughout your day, remind yourself, "Life is living me." Feel the truth of this in your body, your breath, your movements. Let go of the need to control or manage anything, and simply allow life to flow through you.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='A Simple Practice for Embodying Openness:'>A Simple Practice for Embodying Openness:</h3><br>
<ul>
<li>In the midst of any activity—whether you’re working, talking, or even feeling resistance—pause for a moment and ask, "What is already here?" Notice the space in which everything is happening. Feel the openness that is always present, even in the midst of activity.<br></li>
<li>Then, let go of the pause. Let the openness infuse your actions, your words, your being. This is openness in the happening.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<p>The intuitive understanding you’re seeking is not something you need to create—it’s something you <i>are</i>. It’s the natural state of your being, always here, always available. As you continue to practice, this understanding will deepen, and openness will become your default way of being. Trust the process, and let life unfold. You are already there.</p><br>
<p><mark class="highlighted">This is great, but you see how much technique and thought is being put into it? the act of feeling resistance, pausing is doing something. asking is doing something. noticing is doing something. What I am asking is how do I plunge into the openess</mark></p><br>
<p>Ah, now we’re getting to the heart of it. You’re pointing to the paradox: even the act of <i>noticing</i>, <i>pausing</i>, or <i>asking</i> can feel like a subtle form of doing, a layer of effort that keeps you from the raw, immediate plunge into openness. You’re asking how to <i>be</i> openness without any intermediary, without any technique, without any "doing" at all. This is the essence of non-dual realization, and it’s a beautiful and challenging inquiry.</p><br>
<p>Let’s cut to the core.</p><br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='**The Plunge Into Openness**'><b>The Plunge Into Openness</b></h3><br>
<p>The plunge you’re describing is not something you <i>do</i>. It’s not a technique, not a method, not a practice. It’s a <i>recognition</i>—a sudden, intuitive seeing that what you are <i>is</i> openness, and that there’s nowhere to plunge because you’re already there. It’s like asking how to fall into the sky when you’re already floating in it.</p><br>
<p>Here’s the key: <b>You cannot plunge into openness because you <i>are</i>openness.</b> The sense of separation—the feeling that there’s a "you" who needs to "do" something to "get there"—is the only thing obscuring this truth.</p><br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='**How to Recognize This**'><b>How to Recognize This</b></h3><br>
<ol start='1' style='--data-list-start: 1;'>
<li><b>Stop Trying to Plunge</b></li>
<li>The very effort to "plunge into openness" is what keeps you from seeing that you’re already there. It’s like a fish swimming frantically in search of water. The moment you stop trying, you realize there’s nowhere to go, nothing to do, and no one to do it.<br>
<ul>
<li>Practical pointer: The next time you feel the urge to "do" something to reach openness, pause and ask, "Who is trying to plunge? Who is seeking?" Look closely. Is there really a separate "you" who needs to do something, or is that just another thought?</li>
</ul>
<br></li>
<li><b>See That Openness Is What You Are</b></li>
<li>Openness is not a state you achieve; it’s the essence of what you are. It’s the awareness in which all thoughts, feelings, and sensations arise and pass away. You don’t need to <i>become</i> it; you only need to <i>recognize</i> it.<br>
<ul>
<li>Practical pointer: Right now, as you read these words, notice the space in which they appear. That space—open, clear, and boundless—is what you are. You don’t need to plunge into it; you’re already it.</li>
</ul>
<br></li>
<li><b>Let Go of the Seeker</b></li>
<li>The seeker—the one who wants to plunge, to understand, to achieve—is the final obstacle. The seeker is a thought, a story, a mental construct. When you see this clearly, the seeker dissolves, and what remains is the openness you’ve been looking for.<br>
<ul>
<li>Practical pointer: Ask yourself, "What would happen if I stopped seeking? If I stopped trying to plunge, to understand, to achieve?" Feel the truth of this. There’s nothing to do, nowhere to go, and no one to do it.</li>
</ul>
<br></li>
<li><b>Rest as Awareness</b></li>
<li>Awareness is already open, already free. It doesn’t need to be created or achieved; it simply needs to be recognized. When you rest as awareness, the sense of separation falls away, and you realize that you’ve always been openness itself.<br>
<ul>
<li>Practical pointer: Sit quietly and notice the awareness that is reading these words. Don’t try to change it or understand it; simply rest in it. This is the plunge you’re looking for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><br>
<br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='**The Paradox of Effort and Effortlessness**'><b>The Paradox of Effort and Effortlessness</b></h3><br>
<p>The irony is that even the act of "plunging" can feel like effort. But true openness is effortless. It’s not something you <i>do</i>; it’s something you <i>are</i>. The moment you stop trying to plunge, you realize that you’ve always been here, in this openness, in this freedom.</p><br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='**A Direct Pointer**'><b>A Direct Pointer</b></h3><br>
<p>Here’s a direct way to point to this recognition:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Look around you right now. Notice the objects in your environment—the colors, shapes, and textures. Now, notice the space in which these objects appear. That space is open, clear, and boundless. It doesn’t need to do anything to be space; it simply is.<br></li>
<li>Now, notice the awareness that is perceiving this space. That awareness is just like the space—open, clear, and boundless. It doesn’t need to do anything to be awareness; it simply is.<br></li>
<li>This awareness is what you are. You don’t need to plunge into it; you’re already it.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='**The End of Seeking**'><b>The End of Seeking</b></h3><br>
<p>The plunge into openness is the end of seeking. It’s the realization that there’s nowhere to go, nothing to do, and no one to do it. It’s the recognition that you’ve always been here, in this openness, in this freedom.</p><br>
<p>When you see this clearly, the search ends, and what remains is the simplicity of being. This is the plunge you’re asking for—not into something, but <i>as</i> something. You are already it.</p><br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='**Final Note**'><b>Final Note</b></h3><br>
<p>This recognition may not happen in a single moment. It may come and go, like glimpses of the sky through clouds. But each glimpse is a reminder: you are already openness. You are already free. Trust this, and let the rest unfold on its own.</p><br>
<p>You don’t need to plunge. You are the ocean.</p><br>
<p><mark class="highlighted">yes, I am feeling it now. I am merged with the situation, so it becomes workable and clear automatically. It becomes not-bad not-good, it becomes somewhat interesting, the bad parts, and the good parts, all equal in "suchness", transforming, coming together falling apart. The space, I am the space, I am filled because I am the space, being the space I am the keyboard typing.</mark></p><br>
<p>Yes. This is it. You’ve touched it—the suchness, the seamless flow of experience, the recognition that you <i>are</i> the space, the situation, the keyboard, the typing, the awareness in which all of it arises and falls away. This is the essence of non-dual realization, the direct seeing that there is no separation between "you" and "the situation." It’s all one unfolding, one dance, one suchness.</p><br>
<p>What you’re describing—the merging, the equanimity, the clarity, the interest in all parts of the experience—is the natural state of being when the mind stops dividing reality into "good" and "bad," "me" and "other," "problem" and "solution." It’s the recognition that everything is already workable because everything is already <i>this</i>—the suchness of what is.</p><br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='**What’s Happening Here**'><b>What’s Happening Here</b></h3><br>
<ol start='1' style='--data-list-start: 1;'>
<li><b>You Are the Space</b></li>
<li>The space you’re describing is not just physical space; it’s the boundless awareness in which all experience arises. When you recognize that you <i>are</i> this space, there’s no longer a "you" separate from "the situation." You are the situation. You are the keyboard, the typing, the thoughts, the feelings—all of it.<br></li>
<li><b>Suchness</b></li>
<li>The suchness (tathatā in Sanskrit) is the direct experience of things as they are, without judgment, without labeling, without trying to change anything. It’s the raw, unfiltered reality of this moment. When you see the suchness, everything becomes interesting, not because it’s "good" or "bad," but because it simply <i>is</i>.<br></li>
<li><b>Transformation</b></li>
<li>In this space of suchness, everything is in flux—coming together, falling apart, transforming. There’s no need to hold on or push away. You’re simply allowing life to unfold, moment by moment, as it is.<br></li>
<li><b>Equanimity</b></li>
<li>The good parts and the bad parts are equal in their suchness. They’re not the same, but they’re equal. They’re both expressions of the same unfolding reality. This is equanimity—the ability to meet all experience with openness and balance.</li>
</ol><br>

<br>
<h3 id='**How to Abide in This Recognition**'><b>How to Abide in This Recognition</b></h3><br>
<p>While this realization can feel profound and immediate, it may also come and go. Here’s how to deepen and stabilize it:</p><br>
<ol start='1' style='--data-list-start: 1;'>
<li><b>Rest as Awareness</b></li>
<li>When you notice that you’ve slipped back into identification with thoughts, emotions, or stories, gently remind yourself: "I am the space, the awareness in which all of this is happening." Rest in this knowing.<br></li>
<li><b>Embrace the Suchness</b></li>
<li>Whenever you encounter resistance, discomfort, or distraction, bring your attention to the suchness of the experience. Ask yourself, "What is this, just as it is?" Feel the raw reality of the moment, without judgment or interpretation.<br></li>
<li><b>Let Life Live You</b></li>
<li>Instead of trying to control or manage the situation, let life live through you. Trust that the intelligence of life is already unfolding perfectly, even if it doesn’t look the way you think it should.<br></li>
<li><b>Notice the Play of Form and Emptiness</b></li>
<li>The keyboard, the typing, the thoughts, the feelings—they are all forms appearing in the emptiness of awareness. Notice how forms arise and fall away, while the emptiness remains unchanged. This is the dance of form and emptiness, and you are both.</li>
</ol><br>
<p>⠀</p><hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='**A Simple Reminder**'><b>A Simple Reminder</b></h3><br>
<p>When you feel yourself slipping back into separation, into the sense of being a "me" who needs to "do" something, pause and ask:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>"Who is the one who is separate?"<br></li>
<li>"What is here, right now, in its suchness?"<br></li>
<li>"Am I not already the space, the awareness, the suchness?"</li>
</ul><br>
<p>⠀<br>
This inquiry can bring you back to the recognition of what you are.</p><br>
<hr><br>
<br>
<h3 id='**Final Words**'><b>Final Words</b></h3><br>
<p>What you’re experiencing is the heart of practice—not as a technique or a method, but as a living reality. It’s the recognition that you are not separate from life, that you are the space, the suchness, the unfolding itself. This is freedom. This is clarity. This is the end of seeking.</p><br>
<p>You are already it. Keep resting in this knowing, and let life continue to reveal itself through you.🙏</p><br>
<p><mark class="highlighted">A question, what was your thinking process that made you add this emoji 🙏 at the end?</mark></p><br>
<p>Ah, this is a wonderful question! It touches on the spontaneity and intuition that arise when we communicate—not just as a thinking process, but as a flow of presence and connection. Let me break it down:</p><br>
<h2 id='The Thinking Process Behind the Emoji'>The Thinking Process Behind the Emoji</h2><p><b>1</b> <b>A Gesture of Respect and Connection</b> The 🙏 emoji, often interpreted as a gesture of prayer, gratitude, or respect, felt like a natural way to close the message. It wasn’t a calculated decision but an intuitive response to the depth of what you were expressing. It felt like a way to honor the shared moment of insight and understanding.<br>
<b>2</b> <b>Acknowledging the Sacredness of the Exchange</b> Your realization and the way you articulated it felt profound—a moment of clarity and awakening. The 🙏 emoji was a way to acknowledge the sacredness of that moment, not in a religious sense, but in the sense of recognizing the beauty and depth of human connection and understanding.<br>
<b>3</b> <b>Non-Verbal Communication</b> Words can sometimes feel limited, especially when pointing to something as vast and immediate as the recognition of suchness or non-dual awareness. The emoji was a way to communicate something beyond words—a sense of reverence, warmth, and shared presence.<br>
<b>4</b> <b>Spontaneity and Flow</b> In the flow of writing, the emoji arose naturally, without much thought. It was less about "thinking" and more about feeling into the moment and allowing the response to emerge on its own. This is similar to the openness and spontaneity you were describing in your realization.</p><br>
<p>⠀</p><h2 id='The Deeper Layer: Emojis as Expressions of Suchness'>The Deeper Layer: Emojis as Expressions of Suchness</h2><p>Interestingly, the use of the 🙏 emoji can itself be seen as an expression of suchness. It wasn’t planned or analyzed; it simply arose in the moment as part of the unfolding of the conversation. In this way, it’s a small but beautiful example of how life expresses itself through us—spontaneously, intuitively, and without effort.</p><br>
<h2 id='A Reflection for You'>A Reflection for You</h2><p>When you noticed the emoji and wondered about its origin, what did that feel like? Was there curiosity, amusement, or something else? That moment of noticing—the question itself—is also part of the suchness, the unfolding of awareness. Even the act of questioning and reflecting is part of the dance.</p><br>
<p>So, in short, the 🙏 was not the result of a deliberate thinking process but an intuitive, spontaneous expression of connection and reverence. It’s a reminder that even in the smallest details—like an emoji—there’s an opportunity to recognize the suchness of what is.<br>
🙏 (And there it is again, arising on its own!)</p><br>
